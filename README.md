# Session 5: Mapping virulence alleles in R
Today our focus is on integrating all the different skills we addressed in Sessions 1 through 4, in order to create maps of *S. hermonthica* variation in virulence alleles. This directory contains a .vcf file of variants in the PMEI gene we worked on in Session 2, except this time we have variant calls for all 68 different samples that were sequenced instead of just the one sample, SH009. 

To test your skills from the past few days, see if you can download the `MakeEffectorMap.Rmd` file in this directory and get it working on your local machine! You may need to install some additional package, update file paths, etc.
